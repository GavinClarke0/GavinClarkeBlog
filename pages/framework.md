# Framework for Market Dynamics And Predictive Analysis 

This document is living and subject to change. The idea's on monopolistic competition and value capture are largely 
derived from the earlier chapters of Peter Thiel's "Zero to one" and predictive analysis of entities from Marko Papic's 
"Geopolitical alpha". Additional resources and inspiration is also employed. 

This is a framework first and foremost for myself and thus may not be academically rigorous or tested.
