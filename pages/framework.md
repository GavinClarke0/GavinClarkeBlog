# Framework for Market Dynamics And Predictive Analysis 

This document is living and subject to change. The idea's on monopolistic competition and value capture are largely 
derived from the earlier chapters of Peter Thiel's "Zero to one" and predictive analysis of entities from Marko Papic's 
"Geopolitical alpha". Additional resources and inspiration is also employed. 

This is a framework first and foremost for myself and thus may not be academically rigorous or tested. 

# Monopolies and Value 

The only two ways to gain success in a domain, measured monetarily or in any metric that is not independent i.e. 
this does apply to your 5km time unless you are in a race, can be achieved is through monopolization or
out-competing competition. Value capturing and durable entities are often monopolies as a lack/reduction of competition 
prevents the race to zero of perfect competition. 

The size of the available market as well as the difficulty to compete (see predictive constraints) determines 
the possible reward or value capture available. The larger market, and often pre established, may allow a greater total 
reward, however if you are unable to out-compete with a non-replicable differentiation or monopoly of technology, 
branding, economies of scale or network, which itself are monopolies on at least some subset of the market, than the cost 
of competing will likely outweigh the potential to capture a total amount of value. In essence an entity and it's value 
is defined by the total market it is able to monopolize, not the size of the market it is competing for.

In essence these are old lessons repeated, where the age-old advice of differentiation is enhanced to include what allows 
value to be captured, which is the ability to create or find a market which you do not have to compete in. 

The current definition likely makes you think of the standard oil and it's grasp on the american oil trade at the turn 
of the 20th century. Monopolies often exist in more subtle ways and often try to hide this fact and may have even created 
the market itself. For example as given in "Zero To One" is Google's monopoly on search advertising, which it essentially 
created through both a monopoly on technology and creating the market (other early players were destroyed), is often 
rephrased as a non-monopoly on all advertising to distract from the fact they do hold a monopoly. 





As the potential size of a market or total value capture is dynamic and changes with technology, geopolitics, and even 
physical changes to the world infering a monopoly on a novel market 


It is often difficult to determine  the potential size of novel monopolies, 

however monopolies on technology, networks, economies of scale and branding otherwise known
as out-competing competition (if it exists) in an existing market can vbe extrapolated from their current size. I.e. if 
you have a technology monopoly on 



Accurate framing of monopolies is what makes opportunities and evaluation difficult and in
itself is a difficult exercise.
