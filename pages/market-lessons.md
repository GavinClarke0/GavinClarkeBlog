# Lessons On Market Dynamics And Factors

This document is living and subject to change and is a summary and collection on idea's I have read for understanding 
markets of all sizes, geopolitics and the world. The idea's on monopolistic competition and value capture are largely 
derived from the earlier chapters of Peter Thiel's *Zero to one* and predictive analysis of entities from Marko Papic's 
*Geopolitical alpha*, additional resources will also be noted. This is an aggregation of idea's first and foremost for myself and thus not all may not be academically rigorous or 
tested.

# Monopolies and Value 

All entities, be they businesses or nations, exist in relation to each other and depending on this relation compete to 
capture value. As value capture is diverse, and the world ever-changing humans seek new methods of capturing value.
Those that are most successful or "durable" as proposed in *Zero to One* exists as monopolies of at least a specific market. 

### Monopolies and success in a market

The only two ways to gain success in a domain, measured monetarily or in any metric that is not independent, can be 
achieved is through monopolization or out-competing competition. Value capturing and durable entities are often 
monopolies as a lack/reduction of competition prevents the race to zero of perfect competition which can be capitalized on. 

The size of the available market as well as the difficulty to compete (see predictive constraints) determines 
the possible reward or value capture available. The larger market, and often pre established, may allow a greater total 
reward, however if you are unable to out-compete with a non-replicable differentiation or monopoly of technology, 
branding, economies of scale or network, which itself are monopolies on at least some subset of the market, than the cost 
of competing will likely outweigh the potential to capture a total amount of value. In essence an entity and it's value 
is defined by the total market it is able to monopolize, not the size of the market it is competing for.

In essence these are old lessons repeated, where the age-old advice of differentiation is enhanced to include what allows 
value to be captured, which is the ability to create or find a market which you do not have to compete in. 

The current definition likely makes you think of the standard oil, and it's grasp on the american oil trade at the turn 
of the 20th century. Monopolies often exist in more subtle ways and often try to hide this fact and may have even created 
the market itself. For example as given in *Zero To One* is Google's monopoly on search advertising, which it essentially 
created through both a monopoly on technology and creating the market (other early players were destroyed), is often 
rephrased as a non-monopoly on all advertising to distract from the fact they do hold a monopoly. 

The main point is to succeed in any competitive field you either must hold a monopoly or out-compete which is often a monopoly
on aspect in its own right. 

### Value Capture In Relation To Monopolies

Even if you have a monopoly on a market, if you cannot capture value from it the market is useless. Value capture can easily
be measured in business as the amount of value that is profit, typically noncompetitive markets allow a larger percentage of
profit, i.e. as they lack the race to zero of near perfect and perfect competition, and thus maintaining and seeking monopolies
is usually a surefire way of ensuring you are able to capture and not only generate value. 

# Constraints vrs Preference As A Method of Market/GeoPolitical Prediction 

The underplaying idea is predictions are typically based off of what the preferences of the actors in a market, entity
rather than what the constraints require them to do. This is especially true in as geopolitical context when discussing 
the actions of leaders, however I find this principal can be extended as a method of prediction for markets and entities 
of any size.
